Creating the code for studying adsorption of methylene blue on the polyamide surface. 

This initial version is hardcoded for studying methylene blue on polyamide surface generated by make-polymer code by Siva Dasetty. This code will be later modified to study adsorption of any molecule on any other surface.

The idea is to calculate the number of atoms within a certain cut-off distance from center of geometry of polymer for all the molecules. If the number of atoms within the cut-off distance are more than 80% of the atoms of that molecule, then the molecule would be treated as adsorbed on the surface. Please note that consideration for adsorption of atom would be made only on one side of the adsorption surface.
